The software product simulates the functions of an oscilloscope, the program interface is close to the appearance of the oscilloscope itself.

General recommendations for the development of the graphical interface were used:

• Main menu. Implemented by the MainMenu1 component.

• Toolbar of quick keys duplicating the main sections of the menu.

• The context menu (implemented by the PopupMenu1 component), appears when the user right-clicks on the program window or component.

• Tooltip shortcuts that appear when the mouse is hovered over components.

• The colors used in the program are dark on a bright background, so the perception of the program does not tire the user.

• The font and size of the inscriptions in the program are suitable for users.



Description of program windows:
- Oscilloscope v2.0 (Form1): Simulates the appearance of an oscilloscope. In it, you can perform calculations that are carried out in practical work.  
- Calculation formulas (AboutBox): Formulas displayed in the window are necessary for calculations during practical work.  
- About the program (AboutBox1): Contains brief information about the program and a picture of its author.  
- Print (Form2): Prints a report of the completed work in the "Oscillograph v2.0" window.

In this program, the components are placed in such a way to more closely simulate the appearance of an oscilloscope and to approximate the work in the program as quickly as possible.
The components located in the "Oscilloscope v2.0" window (Form1) can be conditionally divided into 4 parts: panel, graph, graph editing and calculation.

The components are located in the "Print" window (Form2) as follows:

The program includes switches and a graphic screen. This program facilitates the student's work:
1) when working with an oscilloscope, the student needs to adjust the clarity and placement of the sine wave, but the user of the software product does not need to do this;
2) in this software product, you can perform all the calculations provided for in the practical work;
3) the program also performs calculations and displays the result after receiving the user's results, thus the user will check the correctness of his calculations;
4) the software product contains a set of formulas necessary for performing calculations.
5) you can print the result of working with the program, the printed material shows the result of the user's calculations and the program itself, which makes it easier for the teacher to check the practical work.
